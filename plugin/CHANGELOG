note:
	- Playback will fail if PCM is used and target device requires MP3 conversion (eg it is a bridge) 
	because the lame conversion rule expects a wav file which means a header. 
	
0.81.0
 - better handling of wav format vs flac
 - added pcm option to hairtunes.c (not usable in LMS as format must be known during transcoding)

0.72.10
 - cannot test *aeskey or aesiv, might start by '0'
 
0.72.9
 - only notify of playback when frame is not silence (all 0) to avoid iOS 10.x spurious play
 - print flush on stdout only if flush done (flush seqno > ab_read)
 - add proper wav file header
 - (P) stop LMS player only when FLUSH acknowledge (found on stdout)
  
0.72.8
 - Try to increase SO_SNDBUF in http thread to try to improve sloppy network behavior
 
0.72.7
 - workaround for wrong SDP session by some client (AirAudio)

0.72.6
 - mDNS broadcast uses LMS socket to avoid issue with multi-home networks
 - try to killall process when plugin terminates

0.72.5
  high CPU usage in http frames handling
 
0.72.4

0.72.3
 - add "HTTP catchup" to better handle network sloppyness
 
0.72.2

 - (P) Add local lib to the end of @INC, not the beginning

0.70.4

 0.70.3
 - Detection of Linux x64 was faulty, x86 was selected instead
 
0.70.2
 - Add arm binaries for Perl 5.24
 
0.70.1 
 - Correct log for fill buffer status
 
0.70.0
 - Cleanup of most of code
 - Synchronization now based on true NTP from server/client
 - Reception of "flush" command over socket should be mutex protected
 - Do not wait fdor "sync" marker to start playback
 
0.61.0
 - Statically link FLAC in Windows
 
0.60.3
 - mDNS broadcast had a TTL < 255, potentially causing some player to not be discovered

0.60.2
 - Solaris detection was wrong
 
0.60.1
 - Sleeping time when no frame available was too long
 - Add buffer level trace every ~5s

0.60.0

 - in RECORD, Audio-Latency set to 44100

0.36.0
 - Remove buffering in helper ==> was conflicting with LMS buffer, creating shuttering
 - Remove some packet retransmission which did not seem necessary (tbc)
 - Buffer only if packets are missing, up to 64 pakcets (x8ms= 512ms)
 
0.35.3
 - Close image proxy socket w/o waiting for the other end to respond
 - helper: when overrun happens, keep the largest amount of buffered audio
