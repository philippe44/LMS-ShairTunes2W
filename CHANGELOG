note:
	- Playback will fail if PCM is used and target device requires MP3 conversion (eg it is a bridge) 
	because the lame conversion rule expects a wav file which means a header.

0.72.10

0.70.1 
 - Correct log for fill buffer status
 
0.70.0
 - Cleanup of most of code
 - Synchronization now based on true NTP from server/client
 - Reception of "flush" command over socket should be mutex protected
 - Do not wait fdor "sync" marker to start playback
 
0.61.0
 - Statically link FLAC in Windows
 
0.60.3
 - mDNS broadcast had a TTL < 255, potentially causing some player to not be discovered
